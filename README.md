# CoMeT: The Cortico-Medial Temporal Index
The code in this repository was used to produce the results and illustrations in [Sreepada et al., 2025, Neurobiology of Aging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458025000995)

CoMeT is an in vivo index summarizing the relative involvement of cortex to medial temporal lobe, as measured by cortical thickness measures in DKT atlas regions derived from T1 MRI. This index is applied to assess the role of biological aging, measured by established epigenetic clocks, in atypical disease presentation in Alzheimer's disease.
